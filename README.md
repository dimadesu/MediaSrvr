## Apps that can work together

See the [demo video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zlWsQYxrE4).

- [MediaSrvr](https://github.com/dimadesu/MediaSrvr) - Runs RTMP server on Android phone. You can publish RTMP stream to it from an action camera, for example.
- [LifeStreamer](https://github.com/dimadesu/LifeStreamer) - Can use RTMP as source: playback RTMP stream from server and restream it as SRT with great dynamic bitrate.
- [Bond Bunny](https://github.com/dimadesu/bond-bunny) - You can use LifeStreamer to publish SRT stream into Bond Bunny app. Bond Bunny accepts SRT as input and forwards packets to SRTLA server like Belabox Cloud. Uses multiple networks to improve stream quality.

## How to Use

### Stop/start

RTMP server starts automatically when the app is opened.

To stop the server tap the button in the notification.

### Publish and play streams on the same device

To publish from a streaming app on your phone to the server on the same phone use this URL:

```
rtmp://localhost:1935/publish/live
```

Play streams on the same device using the same URL. Use an app like VLC player.

### Publish stream from another device to your phone

For example, to publish stream from an action camera to the server on your phone:

- Your phone and action camera have to be on the same Wi-Fi.
- You can create Wi-Fi hotspot with your phone.
- The app builds RTMP URLs for each network that the phone is connected to.
- Configure action camera to connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot and publish to the RTMP URL that is not `localhost`.
