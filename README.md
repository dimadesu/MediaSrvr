# MediaSrvr. RTMP Media Server Android App

Allows running RTMP media server as an Android app.

Proof of concept works. Needs clean-up.

Intended usage is mainly with [LifeStreamer](https://github.com/dimadesu/LifeStreamer) app, but can be used for anything you want really.

Uses:
- [Node Media Server v2](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server/tree/v2).
- Runs NMS using [Node.js mobile](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile).
- Project is based on [Node.js mobile sample app](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile-samples/tree/master/android/native-gradle-node-folder) - needs a lot of updates.

## How to Install
